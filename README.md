# Folderly Desktop Organizer

Folderly is a CLI-based tool to help you organize, declutter, and manage your Desktop folder. It identifies your most and least used files and folders, helps you find duplicates, and allows you to safely move, archive, or clean up unused itemsâ€”while always giving you full control over what stays on your Desktop.

## Features
- Lists all files and folders on your Desktop
- Identifies most and least used items based on recent activity
- Lets you "pin" items to always keep on your Desktop
- Finds duplicates (exact and similar names)
- Interactive prompts for safe cleanup
- Designed for extensibility and user safety

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and set up your Python environment (see `requirements.txt`).
2. Run the test script to see Folderly in action:
   ```sh
   python folderly_tests/test.py
   ```
3. Follow the interactive prompts to review, pin, and clean up your Desktop items.

## Roadmap
- Move/archive/delete unused items
- Create shortcuts for moved files/folders
- Backup and undo system
- AI-powered suggestions (future)
